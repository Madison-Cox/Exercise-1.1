Create a data structure for your Recipe app

#Data Stucture Used
For my recipes, I chose to use 'Dictionary' to store recipe information because the values within itself are indexed by identifiers. Each entry is entered as a key:value pair making it easy to read and utilize when creating recipes. Being able to access individual keys I think will be useful because you can filter recipes by a particular key. For example, If you wanted a quick recipe that takes less than 10 minutes to make, you can filter by Cooking time.
